    ==>It is the basic mineral and the backbone of our development <br>
    ==>India has rich amounts of Iron Ore <br>
    ==>Magnetite is the finest iron ore upto 70% <br>
    ==>It is valuable for its magnetic properties <br>
    ==>Hematite ,Another iron ore has about 50-60%. <br>
    ==>It is an important industrial ore.

    ==>The Major iron belts in india are:- <br><br><br>
    ++>Odisha-Jharkhand belt: In Odisha high
    grade hematite ore is found in Badampahar
    mines in the Mayurbhanj and Kendujhar
    districts. In the adjoining Singbhum
    district of Jharkhand haematite iron ore is
    mined in Gua and Noamundi. <br><br>
    ++>Durg-Bastar-Chandrapur belt lies in
    Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Very high
    grade hematites are found in the famous
    Bailadila range of hills in the Bastar district
    of Chhattisgarh. The range of hills
    comprise of 14 deposits of super high
    grade hematite iron ore. It has the best
    physical properties needed for steel
    making. Iron ore from these mines is
    exported to Japan and South Korea via
    Vishakhapatnam port. <br><br>
    ++>Ballari-Chitradurga-Chikkamagaluru-
    Tumakuru belt in Karnataka has large
    reserves of iron ore. The Kudremukh mines
    located in the Western Ghats of Karnataka
    are a 100 per cent export unit. Kudremukh
    deposits are known to be one of the largest
    in the world. The ore is transported as
    slurry through a pipeline to a port near
    Mangaluru. <br><br>
    ++>Maharashtra-Goa belt includes the state
    of Goa and Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Though, the ores are not of
    very high quality, yet they are efficiently
    exploited. Iron ore is exported through
    Marmagao port. <br><br>
