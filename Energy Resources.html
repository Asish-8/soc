    ==>Energy is required for all activities. It is needed
    to cook, to provide light and heat, to propel
    vehicles and to drive machinery in industries.
    Energy can be generated from fuel
    minerals like coal, petroleum, natural gas,
    uranium and from electricity. <br>
    ==>Energy
    resources can be classified as conventional
    and non-conventional sources. Conventional
    sources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,
    coal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity
    (both hydel and thermal). <br>
    ==>Non-conventional
    sources include solar, wind, tidal, geothermal,
    biogas and atomic energy. <br>
    ==>Firewood and cattle
    dung cake are most common in rural India.<br>
    ==>According to one estimate more than 70 per
    cent energy requirement in rural households
    is met by these two ; continuation of these is
    increasingly becoming difficult due to
    decreasing forest area. <br>
    ==>Moreover, using dung
    cake too is being discouraged because it
    consumes most valuable manure which could
    be used in agriculture.<br>
