    ==> Though, several ores
    contain aluminium, it
    is from bauxite, a
    clay-like substance
    that alumina and
    later aluminium is
    obtained. <br>
    ==>Bauxite
    deposits are formed
    by the decomposition
    of a wide variety of
    rocks rich in
    aluminium silicates. <br>
    ==> Aluminium is an
    important metal
    because it combines
    the strength of metals
    such as iron, with
    extreme lightness
    and also with good
    conductivity and
    great malleability. <br>
    ==>Indiaâ€™s bauxite
    deposits are mainly
    found in the
    Amarkantak plateau, Maikal hills and the
    plateau region of Bilaspur-Katni. <br>
    ==>Odisha was the largest bauxite producing
    state in India in 2016-17. Panchpatmali
    deposits in Koraput district are the most
    important bauxite deposits in the state. <br>

    After the discovery of Aluminium
Emperor Napoleon III wore buttons and
hooks on his clothes made of aluminium
and served food to his more illustrious
guests in aluminium utensils and the
less honourable ones were served in gold
and silver utensils. Thirty years after this
incident aluminium bowls were most
common with the beggars in Paris.
